# Expo Firebase Setup Guide

## ‚úÖ What We Fixed

The issue was that we initially installed native React Native Firebase packages, but for Expo, we need to use the web SDK approach. Here's what we corrected:

### 1. Removed Native Firebase Packages
- Removed `@react-native-firebase/*` packages
- These require native code compilation and Gradle configuration

### 2. Installed Expo-Compatible Firebase
- Using `firebase` web SDK (works with Expo)
- No native configuration needed
- Works across all platforms (iOS, Android, Web)

### 3. Updated Configuration
- Simplified `firebase.config.js` with web SDK
- Removed Gradle configuration requirements
- Updated all imports to use web SDK

## üîß Current Firebase Setup

### Dependencies
```json
{
  "firebase": "^10.x.x",
  "@react-native-async-storage/async-storage": "^2.x.x"
}
```

### Configuration Files
- `firebase.config.js` - Main Firebase configuration
- `services/firebaseService.js` - Firebase service functions
- `contexts/AuthContext.js` - Authentication context

### App Configuration
- `app.json` - Expo configuration (no native plugins needed)
- `google-services.json` - Android configuration (kept for reference)

## üöÄ How It Works

### For Expo Development
1. **Web SDK**: Uses Firebase web SDK which works in Expo
2. **No Native Code**: No need for Gradle or native configuration
3. **Cross-Platform**: Works on iOS, Android, and Web
4. **Development**: Works in Expo Go app and web browser

### For Production Builds
1. **EAS Build**: When you build with EAS, it will handle native configuration
2. **Prebuild**: If you eject to bare workflow, you'll need native configuration
3. **Web**: Works directly in web browsers

## üß™ Testing Firebase

### 1. Run the App
```bash
npm run android
# or
npm run ios
# or
npm run web
```

### 2. Test Connection
1. Open the app
2. Go to Home tab
3. Scroll to "Firebase Integration" section
4. Tap "Test Connection" button
5. Should show "Connected ‚úÖ"

### 3. Test Firestore
1. Tap "Add Test Data to Firestore" button
2. Check Firebase Console ‚Üí Firestore Database
3. Look for "test" collection with new document

## üî• Firebase Console Setup

### 1. Authentication
1. Go to [Firebase Console](https://console.firebase.google.com/)
2. Select project: `salon16`
3. Navigate to **Authentication** ‚Üí **Sign-in method**
4. Enable **Email/Password** authentication

### 2. Firestore Database
1. Go to **Firestore Database**
2. Click **Create database**
3. Choose **Start in test mode**
4. Select location (closest to your users)

### 3. Storage
1. Go to **Storage**
2. Click **Get started**
3. Choose **Start in test mode**
4. Select location (same as Firestore)

### 4. Security Rules
Use the rules provided in `FIREBASE_SETUP.md` for production.

## üì± Platform-Specific Notes

### Android
- `google-services.json` is kept for reference
- No Gradle configuration needed for Expo
- Works in Expo Go and development builds

### iOS
- No `GoogleService-Info.plist` needed for Expo
- Works in Expo Go and development builds
- Will be needed if you eject to bare workflow

### Web
- Works directly in web browsers
- No additional configuration needed
- Great for development and testing

## üöÄ Next Steps

### 1. Test the Setup
- Run the app and test Firebase connection
- Verify Firestore operations work
- Test authentication flow

### 2. Firebase Console Configuration
- Enable Authentication (Email/Password)
- Create Firestore database
- Set up Storage bucket
- Configure security rules

### 3. Development
- Start building booking features
- Use Firebase services for data operations
- Implement authentication flow

## üîç Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

1. **"Firebase connection failed"**
   - Check if Firestore is enabled in Firebase Console
   - Verify internet connection
   - Check Firebase project configuration

2. **"Permission denied"**
   - Check Firestore security rules
   - Ensure database is in test mode initially
   - Verify authentication status

3. **"Module not found"**
   - Make sure you're using `firebase` (web SDK)
   - Not `@react-native-firebase/*` packages
   - Check import statements

### Debug Tips
- Check console logs for Firebase errors
- Use Firebase Console to monitor operations
- Test with simple operations first

## ‚úÖ Verification Checklist

- [ ] Firebase web SDK installed (`firebase` package)
- [ ] No native Firebase packages (`@react-native-firebase/*`)
- [ ] App builds and runs successfully
- [ ] Firebase test component shows "Connected ‚úÖ"
- [ ] Test data can be added to Firestore
- [ ] Firebase Console shows test data
- [ ] Authentication is enabled in Firebase Console
- [ ] Firestore database is created
- [ ] Storage bucket is created

## üéØ Benefits of This Approach

1. **Simpler Setup**: No native configuration needed
2. **Faster Development**: Works in Expo Go
3. **Cross-Platform**: Same code for iOS, Android, Web
4. **Easy Testing**: Can test in web browser
5. **Expo Compatible**: Works with all Expo features
