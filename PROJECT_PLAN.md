## üîß Technical Decisions & Architecture Updates

### **Language Migration**
- **From TypeScript to JavaScript**: Converted entire codebase to JavaScript for faster development
- **Type Safety**: Using PropTypes and runtime validation instead of compile-time checking
- **Development Speed**: Reduced build times and simplified development workflow

### **Storage Solution Change**
- **From Firebase Storage to Cloudinary**: 
  - **Reason**: Firebase Storage requires paid billing plan
  - **Benefits**: Free tier with 25GB storage, automatic image optimization, CDN delivery
  - **Implementation**: Direct API calls instead of Firebase SDK for better React Native compatibility

### **Theme System Architecture**
- **Context-Based**: Centralized theme management using React Context
- **Design Tokens**: Comprehensive system of colors, typography, spacing, shadows
- **Component Variants**: Multiple styles for different use cases (primary, secondary, accent, etc.)

- **Light/Dark Mode**: Automatic system detection with manual override

### **Component Architecture**
- **Themed Components**: All components use theme system for consistency
- **Variant System**: Flexible styling through variant props
- **Composition**: Reusable components that can be composed for complex UIs
- **Accessibility**: Proper contrast ratios and touch targets built-in

### **Error Handling Strategy**
- **Network Resilience**: Graceful handling of network connectivity issues
- **Offline Mode**: Firebase works in offline mode with data sync
- **User Feedback**: Clear error messages and loading states
- **Fallback UI**: Graceful degradation when services are unavailable

### **Performance Optimizations**
